<h1> Forensic Utilities Lab </h1> :mag_right:


<h2>Description</h2>
Upon completing the lab, I was able to gather potential forensic evidence from a running system while maintaining forensic integrity. I gained proficiency in identifying system states and evidence using Helix and explored bootable forensic utilities effectively. I learned to select the right forensic tools for specific data collection tasks and successfully created detailed reports on running processes and browser usage for a Windows workstation.
